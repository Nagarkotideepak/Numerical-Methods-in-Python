# Numerical-Methods-in-Python
Program the numerical methods to create simple and efficient Python codes that output the numerical solutions
# Numerical Methods Using Python
Numerical methods implementation in Python 3.
## Getting Started
The numerical methods, or numerical analysis, are simplified procedures to get approximate
numerical solutions to equations and problems in algebra, calculus and other fields of
mathematics.

### Prerequisites
* Some basic understanding of algebra and calculus, and programming.
* Python Basic and IDE, NumPy, matplotib and SciPy.

### Running the examples

To run the main example, use:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
