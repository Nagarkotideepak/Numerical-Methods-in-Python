Simple Iterations Method
The simple iterations is the simplest method used in finding roots of high-degree equation.
In this method, the equations is rearranged to have the variable on the left side or the
equation. An initial value of the variable, known as initial guess, substituted in the right side
and a new value for the variable calculated. In the second iteration (repeat) the new value
substituted on the right side. This cycle will continue until the old value and resulting new
value of the variable become, theoretically, equal. Thus, this value will be one of the roots of
the equations. Other root can be found with the same manner just by changing the initial
guess.
Now, letâ€™s write solution steps in the following algorithm:
1- Rearrange the equation so that the variable is put on the left side
2- Assume (guess) an initial value of the variable to start the first iteration
3- Substitute the value of the variable in the right side of the equation and calculate an
new value for the variable
4- If the new value of the variable is not equal to the previous value, consider the new one
as the value of the variable.
5- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the new value is equal to the old value of the variable.
6- In case the new value does not approach the old value (difference increases at each
iteration) stop calculation and try another initial value or another rearrangement of the
given equation.
